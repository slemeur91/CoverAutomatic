2. Extract and copy the `custom_components/cover_automatic` folder to your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Add the integration via **Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **Add Integration**

---

## Configuration

After installation, all configuration is done via the **CoverAutomatic** sidebar panel:

1. **Covers** - Add cover entities to manage
2. **Facades** - Define building facades by cardinal direction (with compass visualization)
3. **Rules** - Create automation rules with conditions (sun, temperature, time, weather, etc.). Conditions can be negated (NOT) and organised in groups, e.g. (A OR B) AND (C OR D); duplicate an existing rule to use it as a starting point
4. **Scenarios** - Define modes like "Summer", "Winter", "Vacation". Each rule chooses the scenarios it belongs to (all by default); inside a scenario a member rule can still be switched off temporarily
5. **Settings** - Configure sensors, comfort temperatures, wind protection, and more

### Example: heat protection by outdoor temperature

To shade a facade once it gets hot outside, combine two conditions in one rule
(operator **AND**). No extra setting is required — `temperature_above` reads the
global outdoor temperature sensor from **Settings** by default.

1. Set an **outdoor temperature sensor** in Settings.
2. Create a rule, e.g. *"Heat protection South"*:
   - Condition `sun_on_facade` → your south facade
   - Condition `temperature_above` → `28` (°C)
   - Target position → e.g. `30` (partly closed)
3. Optional: give it a higher priority than your everyday daylight rule so it
   wins while the sun is on the facade and it is hot.

The rule closes the cover only while the sun actually hits that facade **and**
the outdoor temperature is above the threshold, and releases it again once
either condition clears.

### Conditions on any entity (Home Assistant conditions)

The **Entities** group of the *Add condition* menu adds a condition evaluated
by Home Assistant itself, in the same format as the `condition:` section of an
automation:

- **Entity state** / **Entity numeric value** open a form: pick the entity,
  optionally an attribute, then the states (proposed as buttons, e.g. the zones
  of a person), *is / is not*, a minimum duration, or above / below / between.
- **Home Assistant condition (YAML)** accepts any automation condition —
  templates, zones, devices, nested `and` / `or` / `not`:

```yaml
condition: or
conditions:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: media_player.living_room
    state: [playing, paused]
  - condition: template
    value_template: "{{ states('sensor.lux') | float(0) > 20000 }}"
```

Each card has a **Form / YAML** switch, is checked by Home Assistant while you
type and shows the entities it watches (rules react to them immediately). An
invalid or incomplete condition is kept but never matches and is marked in red.
Existing "State is" / "Numeric value" conditions keep working and can be
converted with one click.

### Created Entities

For each managed cover, the integration creates:

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `switch.*_auto` | Enable/disable automation |
| `sensor.*_status` | Current status (auto/paused/manual/locked/venting/wind_protected). Attributes `rule_name`, `rule_id` and `target_position` show the rule currently in control (empty while paused, manual or protected) |

For each facade:
| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `sensor.*_sun` | Sun on facade indicator (on/off) |
| `sensor.*_sun_entry` | Time when sun enters facade (today, computed from the real solar path of your location) |
| `sensor.*_sun_exit` | Time when sun leaves facade today |

Entities are created and removed automatically when covers or facades are added or deleted in the panel -- no reload needed.

Global:
- `select.cover_automatic_scenario` - Active scenario selector

Note: The integration controls your original cover entities directly. No wrapper entities are created.

### Available Services

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `cover_automatic.pause` | Pause automation for a cover |
| `cover_automatic.resume` | Resume automation for a cover |
| `cover_automatic.pause_all` | Pause all covers |
| `cover_automatic.resume_all` | Resume all covers |
| `cover_automatic.set_scenario` | Set active scenario |
| `cover_automatic.export_config` | Export configuration to YAML |
| `cover_automatic.import_config` | Import configuration from YAML |

## Troubleshooting

Most "bugs" turn out to be one of the safety mechanisms below doing its job. Please check this list before opening an issue.

### Covers don't move right after a Home Assistant restart

By design. After startup, CoverAutomatic waits **120 seconds** before applying any positions. This grace period prevents wrong movements while sensors are still reporting incomplete data (e.g. a Zigbee bridge that hasn't reconnected yet). Automation starts on the first scan after the grace period.

### A cover suddenly shows PAUSED

CoverAutomatic detected a **manual override**: the cover was moved by something other than CoverAutomatic itself — a wall switch, a remote, another automation, or the HA UI. Automation for that cover pauses for the configured pause duration (global or per-cover) so your manual choice is respected, then resumes automatically. Resume earlier via the **X** button in the panel or the `cover_automatic.resume` service.

For slow covers that report neither intermediate positions nor *opening* / *closing*, the integration waits for the cover's **travel time** (measured automatically, or set per cover under *Advanced → Travel time*) before judging a position as manual. If a slow cover is still paused wrongly right after an automatic move, set its travel time a little above the real one.

### A rule matches but the cover doesn't move

Check in this order:

1. **Status priority** — WIND_PROTECTED, LOCKED (window open), VENTING (window tilted) and PAUSED all override rule evaluation. The covers table in the panel shows the current status and the winning rule per cover.
2. **Master switch / per-cover automation toggle** — both must be on.
3. **Active scenario** — only rules that belong to the active scenario (and are not switched off in it) are considered.
4. **Minimum time between changes** — position changes are rate-limited by the configured interval; the move happens on a later scan.

### A sun rule doesn't shade

`sun_on_facade` is comfort-aware: in **HEATING** mode (room below comfort range) shading is blocked to let the sun warm the room. In **NEUTRAL** mode shading additionally requires the solar radiation sensor to be above the threshold (preemptive shading, can be disabled per cover). In **COOLING** mode (room above comfort range) shading always applies.

### Cover is stuck in LOCKED or VENTING

These statuses are derived from the configured window contact sensors: lock = window open (automation fully blocked), vent = window tilted (cover keeps a minimum position). If the sensor itself is `unavailable` or `unknown`, the last derived status is kept for safety — check the sensor, not the integration.

### Panel looks broken or outdated after an update

The panel JS is cache-busted per version, but some browsers hold on to it anyway. Hard-reload the browser (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R) or clear the app cache in the HA companion app.

### Enable debug logging

Settings → Devices & Services → **CoverAutomatic** → three-dot menu → **Enable debug logging**. Reproduce the issue, then disable debug logging the same way — Home Assistant offers the captured log as a download. Attach it to your bug report together with an export from `cover_automatic.export_config`.

## Privacy

- **Update check:** When the configuration panel is open, it makes an anonymous `GET` request to the public GitHub API (`api.github.com`, hosted in the USA) to read the latest published release tag and show an update hint. No account, token, or personal data is sent; it is a standard unauthenticated request. You can disable this entirely via **Settings → Automation → Check for updates** — with the option off, no outbound request is made. Automation itself never contacts GitHub.
- **Configuration export:** Exported/imported YAML contains your sensor and cover entity IDs. Entity IDs you named after rooms or people (e.g. `cover.bedroom_anna`) may carry a personal reference. Treat export files like any other config backup and store them accordingly.
